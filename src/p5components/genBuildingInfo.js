/*
  Building Generator sets up the size, shape, and number of stories
  of the building we want to put fire escapes on to

  I am not actually sure the building itself is important
  Maybe I just want to generate the windows?

  This is also really tricky to work with and would benefit perhaps
  from a node-based approach - like, set controls on a config key visibly

  This would be a good project for writing a generator engine?
