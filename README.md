# Getting Started

This package is written to provide a similar mental development environment to a React application, with use of `import` statements and code separation in a semi-functional programming mode. It's a mess!

### Boot Up
* `npm install`
* `npm audit fix --force`


#### Common Problems

1. Webpack won't turn on dev server
    * Have you checked that `static` is not currently `contentBase` in webpack.config.js
